# What is g0v
g0v_intro: "What is g0v?"
g0v_description: "g0v is a grassroots level social movement community dedicated to deepening the civic engagements and connections between social arena and citizen. You can find like-minded partners in the g0v community, achieve your ideas in a grassroots manner, then release the results under an opensource license, thus more people can stand on your shoudlers."
g0v_description2: "g0v replaces \"o\" in gov with \"0\", which reimagines the role of government from scratch zero and reflects the vision from 0 to 1 of the digital natives."
operatingStyle: "How g0v Works"
operatingBlurb: "g0v.tw primarily operates online with a large hackathon occurring once every two months. Participants propose different projects and call for volunteers. Oftentimes, in addition to meeting at the hackathons, projects will split off, holding their own smaller meetups and hackathons independent of the larger g0v events. This operating mode encourages bottom-up ideation, fostering activism over slacktivism."
hackathonBlurb: "(Note: Hackathon is a portmanteau of \"hacker\" and \"marathon\", a large-scale event that takes place over the course of one to two days. Volunteers form groups, work and report their progress. Many projects will meet before the event and form a plan for the day, to make sure they can get as much done as possible in the limited time available.)"
communityMakeup: "People Who Make g0v"
communityBlurb: "Members of g0v are both online and offline and come from all fields. The only requirement is that you believe in the principal of open-source collaboration, you don’t need to be a software engineer. In the early days, most members of g0v were software engineers, but now over 60% of participants are not from a tehcnical background."
cantCode: "Is it a problem if I can’t write code? <b>Not at all!</b>"
